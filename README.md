# Flappy Bird Clone

This was made following this tutorial: [Create Flappy Bird clone in Javascript HTML CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5ADM2uywg)

I have always loved video games, so of course Flappy Bird is a classic for me. Since I am already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS, I thought following this tutorial would be a good start. I plan to use what I learned from this experience in future projects.
